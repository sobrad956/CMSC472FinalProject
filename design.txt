Script: 

#Create 1 train/test split to work on.
#For each augmentation:
    #For each level of severity:
        #Instantiate and train each model
           # *Save best version of each model as .pth using validation set.
           # *Save loss and accuracy at each iteration.
           # *Save model
        #Test each model
           # *Save loss and accuracy at each iteration.
        #Train GAN, generate 50% more training data
        #Re-instantiate and train each model
            # *Ditto
        #Re-test each model
            # *Ditto
            
            
            
            
To-do:
    * Object-orient all of the models and training scripts
    * Calculate all correct performance metrics
    * Create detailed logs and save models accurately
    * Test on GPU
    * Test if training properly
    * Create GAN
    * Test if training with GAN works
    * Create feature visualizations
    * Create feature maps
